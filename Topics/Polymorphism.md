# Polymorphism


In short polymorphism is the condition of occurence in difference forms. Confused ?

Lets look a example.

Polymorphism in addition operator:
***main.py***
```
x = 10
y = 20
print(x+y)

a = "Arif "
b = "Shahriar"
print(a+b)
```
***output:***
```
30
Arif Shahriar
```

Here `+` operator performs mathematical addition for integers and concatination for strings. Same operator does different operation for different data types. This is the Polymorphism of addition operator.
